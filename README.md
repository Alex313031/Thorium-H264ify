__Fork of enhanced-h264ify for [Thorium](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium).__

## About
Thorium H264ify is a fork of [enhanced-h264ify](https://github.com/alextrv/enhanced-h264ify), which is itself a fork of the well-known [h264ify](https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify) extension for Firefox/Chromium, which blocks [VP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8)/[VP9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9) codecs on YouTube, so that you can use [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) only. This may be useful because there are lots of devices on the market which support H.264 hardware decoding and do not support VP8/VP9.

This extension has new features such as manual blocking of H.264, VP8, VP9, [AV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1) codecs and [60fps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate) video. By default it blocks everything but H.264 and 60fps video. \
It works only on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
