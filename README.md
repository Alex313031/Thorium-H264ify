__Fork of enhanced-h264ify for Thorium.__

## About
Thorium H264ify is a fork of [enhanced-h264ify](https://github.com/alextrv/enhanced-h264ify), which is itself a fork of the well-known [h264ify](https://github.com/erkserkserks/h264ify) extension for Firefox/Chromium, which blocks VP8/VP9 codecs on YouTube, so that you can use H.264 only. This may be useful because there are lots of devices on the market which support H.264 hardware decoding and do not support VP8/VP9.

This extension has new features such as manual blocking of H.264, VP8, VP9, AV1 codecs and 60fps video. By default it blocks everything but H.264 and 60fps video. \
It works only on YouTube.
